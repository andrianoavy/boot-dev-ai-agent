# Boot.dev AI Agent

## Description

Simple ai agent created to learn how they work under the hood from a simplist point of view. For this example, the course made me use Gemini(gemini-2.0-flash-001) with the gemini API. The code contains a calculator app that the agent can work on.

## How to run

- create a python environnement
- install the `requirements.txt`
- run `python main.py "your_prompt"` and enjoy!

## What can the AI do?

For now, the agent can only use these functions(as directed in the course):

- List files and directories
- Read file contents
- Execute Python files with optional arguments
- Write or overwrite files

## Contribution

Just clone the repo if you want, it's a course app after all. I don't expect to do anything with it yet.
